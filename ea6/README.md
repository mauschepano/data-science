# Data Cleaning Excercise
## Have a look at the following dataset: dsm-beuth-edl-demodata-orig

Write a Python / Panda Script which 'cleans' this data set. Justify your actions in the respective notebook or python script you provide as a solution (link, file, kaggle repo, etc.).

The original dataset does not necessarily have to be created. A proper strategy / good arguments are more important. Value: 5 points.
