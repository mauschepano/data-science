# RAJ - R and Julia

Do the exercise at the end of the lecture!

### Exercise 1 (R)
Write a program to guess a number in between0 and 100! Hence the computer invents the number and the user = you tries to guess it!

### Exercise 2 (R)
Analyse the esoph dataset. Can you derive some useful statements from it? Use data() to see all available datasets.

### Exercise 3 (J)
Create a 2x4 two dimensional matrix with random floats in it and in the next step determine the biggest element.

### Exercise 4 (J)
1. Create two matrices of the same layout and test if addition and subtraction of the matrix works as expected: C = A + B

2. Now compare matrix multiplication either this way A * B and this way A .* B. Whats the difference?!

3. What about matrix division with "/" or "\\"?!

    > x / y : performs division

    > x \	y : is an inverse division and the equivalent to y / x

4. Create a 3x3 integer matrix A with useful numbers. Now try A+1, A-1, A*2, A/2.

5. Now multiply a 3x4 matrix with a suitable (4)vector.
